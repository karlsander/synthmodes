		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">6 LFOs with reset triggers; 0-8v outputs.  All slopes are free-running, cycling up &amp; down at rates defined by <em>TIME</em> &amp; <em>INTONE</em>.</p>
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>TIME</b>: Controls the period of <em>IDENTITY</em>'s cycle.<br>
			<br>
			<b>INTONE</b>: Defines tempic relationships of each generator by controlling the ratio of each of <em>2N</em> through <em>6N</em>'s period to IDENTITY's.  At noon, all periods are equal to <em>IDENTITY</em>'s.  Clockwise accelerates each of <em>2N</em> through <em>6N</em> towards integer multiples as defined by their labels, vs elongation into integer divisions counterclockwise.<br>
			<br>
			<b>FM Input + Attenuverter</b>: Turning CCW towards <em>INTONE</em> allows attenuated modulation of <em>INTONE</em>.  Turn clockwise to allow attenuated linear FM.  With nothing patched, there is a positive offset (digitally) normalled, allowing detune control CW and additional <em>INTONE</em> control CCW. To ensure accuracy of the <em>INTONE</em> pot, set <em>FM</em> to 12:00.<br>
			<br>
			<b>RAMP</b>: Skews slopes from sawtooth, through asymetrical triangles to ramp waves.  Like <em>MANGROVE</em>'s barrel, the overall <em>TIME</em> is maintained, while blending the shape (sets the ratio of rise to fall time without adjusting total duration).<br>
			<br>
			<b>CURVE</b>: Blends the slopes from default linear gradients at 12:00.  CW passes through lazy 'log' shapes, and reaches cosines at the extreme.  CCW twists to snappy 'expo' curves then slides through trapezoids and into squares (with pulsewidth set by <em>RAMP</em>).<br>
			<br>
			<b>TRIGGERS</b>: Normalized from right to left, a <em>TRIGGER</em> in the rightmost will apply to all six.  Any slope that receives a <em>TRIGGER</em> immediately restarts its cycle immediately at the start of its attack phase.  <em>TRIGGER</em>ing only 6N will synchronize all channels due to their normalization.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Outputs</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>INDIVIDUAL OUTS</b> are 0-8v unipolar LFOs.<br>
			<br>			
			<b>MIX</b> provides a combination of all active slopes.  After dividing each slope by its <em>OUT</em> number, the maximum value is output.<br>

			<b>TRIGGERS</b>: Normalized from right to left, a <em>TRIGGER</em> in the rightmost will apply to all six.  Any slope that receives a <em>TRIGGER</em> slopes high, then falls once the input goes low.  If the slope reaches maximum it will sustain as long as the gate input is high.<br>

		<h3>Summary</h3>

		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>RUN</b> controls the number of cycles launched each time a <em>TRIGGER</em> is received.  Six repetitions occur at <em>VOLLEY=0</em>, with decreasing in the negative down to none below -4v.  Positive voltages move up to 36 cycles.<br>
			<br>
			All kinds of bizarre self-modulation sequences are possible by self-patching outs into CV or <em>TRIGGER</em> inputs, all started by a single external excitation.<br>

	<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">Creates an additional plateau in each envelope, allowing 'ARSR' style envelopes by sending gates to <em>TRIGGER</em> inputs.  The sustain level is determined by the <em>STRATA</em> input at the <em>RUN</em> jack.</p>
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			<b>RUN</b> controls where in the decay phase the plateau occurs. Gates to the <em>TRIGGER</em> inputs are followed as normal, however at the end-of-rise the output will start falling until it reaches the <em>STRATA</em> input.<br>
			<br>
			At zero, <em>STRATA</em> is half-way through the release.  With <em>CURVE</em> at 12:00, this means 4v output, or -6dB into a linear VCA, though <em>CURVE</em> will drastically affect this voltage.  Positive <em>STRATA</em> moves the hold level higher, while negative input approaches the minimum.<br>

		<h3>Controls</h3>

			<b>RUN</b> sets the retrigger point to end-of-rise when at 0v or dummied, opposed to end-of-cycle as per normal (no <em>RUN</em> cable).  Accepted retriggers start the envelope over by jumping instantly to zero before ramping up.<br>

			Negative voltages bring the sensitivity forward in the cycle to 'always' (-5v), while positive votlages push toward the end-of-cycle, operating equivalently to <em>SHAPE/TRANSIENT</em> at +5v.

			<b>RUN</b> sets the ratio of internal cosine modulator frequency to carrier output frequency.  At 0v, the modutor's frequency equals the carriers.  At 5v, modulator is double carrier's frequency.  At -5v, modulator is half of carrier's frequency.<br>

			<b>TRIGGERS</b> are gate sensitive and used to strike LPGs, so longer pulses can hold <em>PLUME</em>s open, while short spikes sound more softly.<br>
